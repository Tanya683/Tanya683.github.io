I’m a Software Developer experienced in building enterprise-grade applications using Java, Python, Spring Boot, and FastAPI.



I’ve delivered projects involving microservice design, secure credential management, automation of system audits, CI/CD optimization, and large-scale infrastructure migration. My work includes modernizing legacy systems, developing high-performance APIs, achieving 80%+ test coverage, and improving deployment reliability. I enjoy working on challenging backend problems and creating solutions that scale.
